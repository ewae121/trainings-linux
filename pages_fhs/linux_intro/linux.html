    <h1>Linux</h1>
      <p>Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel. An operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution, which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project.</p>

    <h1>Design</h1>
      <p>Many open source developers agree that the Linux kernel was not designed but rather evolved through natural selection. Torvalds considers that although the design of Unix served as a scaffolding, "Linux grew with a lot of mutations â€“ and because the mutations were less than random, they were faster and more directed than alpha-particles in DNA."</p>

  A Linux System generaly contains:
  <ul>
    <li><b>A bootloader</b>, for example GNU GRUB, LILO, SYSLINUX or systemd-boot. This is a program that loads the Linux kernel into the computer's main memory, by being executed by the computer when it is turned on and after the firmware initialization is performed.</li>
    <li><b>An init program</b>, such as the traditional sysvinit and the newer systemd, OpenRC and Upstart. This is the first process launched by the Linux kernel, and is at the root of the process tree: in other terms, all processes are launched through init. It starts processes such as system services and login prompts (whether graphical or in terminal mode).</li>
    <li><b>Software libraries</b>, which contain code that can be used by running processes. On Linux systems using ELF-format executable files, the dynamic linker that manages the use of dynamic libraries is known as ld-linux.so. If the system is set up for the user to compile software themselves, header files will also be included to describe the programming interface of installed libraries. Besides the most commonly used software library on Linux systems, the GNU C Library (glibc), there are numerous other libraries, such as SDL and Mesa.</li>
    <li><b>C standard library</b> is the library needed to run C programs on a computer system, with the GNU C Library being the standard. For embedded systems, alternatives such as the musl, EGLIBC (a glibc fork once used by Debian) and uClibc (which was designed for uClinux) have been developed, although the last two are no longer maintained. Android uses its own C library, Bionic.</li>
    <li><b>Basic Unix commands</b>, with GNU coreutils being the standard implementation. Alternatives exist for embedded systems, such as the copyleft BusyBox, and the BSD-licensed Toybox.</li>
    <li><b>Widget toolkits</b> are the libraries used to build graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for software applications. Numerous widget toolkits are available, including GTK and Clutter developed by the GNOME Project, Qt developed by the Qt Project and led by The Qt Company, and Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL) developed primarily by the Enlightenment team.</li>
    <li><b>A package management system</b>, such as dpkg and RPM. Alternatively packages can be compiled from binary or source tarballs.</li>
    <li><b>User interface programs</b> such as command shells or windowing environments.</li>
  <ul>

  <h1>Linux Filesystem</h1>

  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file">Everything is a file.</a>

  <h2>File pathes</h2>

  A Linux file path indicates where to find a path. 

  <p>Example: /usr/sbin/ip</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>ip</b> is the basename</li> 
  </ul>

  <p>When a path <b>start by a "/"</b>, it is an <b>Absolute path</b>. Otherwise it is a <b>Relative path</b>.</p>A relative path is always related to the current working directory (generally: .)

  <p>Some special folders:</p>

  <h2>Filesystem Hierachy Standard</h2>

The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) is a reference describing the conventions used for the layout of a UNIX system. It has been made popular by its use in Linux distributions, but it is used by other UNIX variants as well. It is maintained by the Linux Foundation. The latest version is 3.0, released on 3 June 2015.

<p>There has been controversy over the meaning of the name itself. In early versions of the UNIX Implementation Document from Bell labs, <code>/etc</code> is referred to as the <i>etcetera directory</i>, as this directory historically held everything that did not belong elsewhere (however, the FHS restricts <code>/etc</code> to static configuration files and may not contain binaries). Since the publication of early documentation, the directory name has been re-explained in various ways. Recent interpretations include backronyms such as "Editable Text Configuration" or "Extended Tool Chest".

<h1>Mount points</h1>
  <p>All files accessible in a Unix system are arranged in one big tree, the file hierarchy, rooted at /. These files can be spread out over several devices. The mount command serves to attach the filesystem found on some device to the big file tree. Conversely, the umount(8) command will detach it again.</p>
  <p>The filesystem is used to control how data is stored on the device or provided in a virtual way by network or other services.</p>
