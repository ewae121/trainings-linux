    <h1>Linux</h1>
      <p>
<b>A Linux distribution(often abbreviated as distro) is an operating system made from a software collection that includes the Linux kernel, and often a package management system.</b></p>

      <p>Linux users usually obtain their operating system by downloading one of the Linux distributions, which are available for <b>a wide variety of systems</b> ranging from <b>embedded devices</b> (for example, OpenWrt) and <b>personal computers</b> (for example, Linux Mint) to <b>powerful supercomputers</b> (for example, Rocks Cluster Distribution).</p>

      <p><b>A typical Linux distribution comprises a Linux kernel, GNU tools and libraries, additional software, documentation, a window system (the most common being the X Window System, or, more recently, Wayland), a window manager, and a desktop environment.</b></p>

      <p>Most of the included software is free and open-source software made available <b>both as compiled binaries and in source code form</b>, allowing modifications to the original software. Usually, Linux distributions optionally include some proprietary software that may not be available in source code form, such as binary blobs required for some device drivers.</p>

      <p>A Linux distribution may also be <b>described as a particular assortment of application and utility software (various GNU tools and libraries, for example), packaged with the Linux kernel in such a way that its capabilities meet many users' needs.</b> The software is usually adapted to the distribution and then combined into software packages by the distribution's maintainers. The software packages are available online in repositories, which are storage locations usually distributed around the world. Beside "glue" components, such as the distribution installers (for example, Debian-Installer and Anaconda) and the package management systems, <b>very few packages are actually written by a distribution's maintainers.</b></p>

    <p><b>Almost one thousand Linux distributions exist.</b> Because of the huge availability of software, distributions have taken a wide variety of forms, including those suitable for use on desktops, servers, laptops, netbooks, mobile phones and tablets, as well as in minimal environments typically for use in embedded systems. There are commercially backed distributions, such as Fedora Linux (Red Hat), openSUSE (SUSE) and Ubuntu (Canonical Ltd.); and entirely community-driven distributions, such as Debian, Slackware, Gentoo and Arch Linux. Most distributions come ready-to-use and precompiled for a specific instruction set, while some (such as Gentoo) are distributed mostly in source code form and must be compiled locally for installation.</p>

    <h1>Distributions - Main examples</h1>
      <h2>Widely used GNU-based or GNU-compatible distributions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Debian, a non-commercial distribution and one of the earliest, maintained by a volunteer developer community with a strong commitment to free software principles and democratic project management.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Ubuntu, a desktop and server distribution derived from Debian, maintained by British company Canonical Ltd.
            <ul>
              <li>There are several distributions based on Ubuntu that mainly replace the GNOME stock desktop environment, like: Kubuntu based on KDE, Lubuntu based on LXQT, Xubuntu based on XFCE, Ubuntu MATE based on MATE, Ubuntu Budgie based on Budgie. Other official forks have specific uses like: Ubuntu Kylin for Chinese-speaking users, or Ubuntu Studio for media content creators.</li>
              <li>Linux Mint, a distribution based on and compatible with Ubuntu. Supports multiple desktop environments, among others GNOME Shell fork Cinnamon and GNOME 2 fork MATE.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Fedora Linux, a community distribution sponsored by American company Red Hat and the successor to the company's previous offering, Red Hat Linux. It aims to be a technology testbed for Red Hat's commercial Linux offering, where new open-source software is prototyped, developed, and tested in a communal setting before maturing into Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), a derivative of Fedora Linux, maintained and commercially supported by Red Hat. It seeks to provide tested, secure, and stable Linux server and workstation support to businesses.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          openSUSE, a community distribution mainly sponsored by German company SUSE.
          <ul>
            <li>
              SUSE Linux Enterprise, derived from openSUSE, maintained and commercially supported by SUSE
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Arch Linux, a rolling release distribution targeted at experienced Linux users and maintained by a volunteer community, offers official binary packages and a wide range of unofficial user-submitted source packages. Packages are usually defined by a single PKGBUILD text file.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Manjaro Linux, a derivative of Arch Linux that includes a graphical installer and other ease-of-use features for less experienced Linux users.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Gentoo, a distribution targeted at power users, known for its FreeBSD Ports-like automated system for compiling applications from source code</li>

    <h2>Linux kernel based operating systems</h2>
      <p>Android, Google's commercial operating system based on Android OSP that runs on many devices such as smart phones, smart TVs, set-top boxes.</p>
      <p>ChromeOS, Google's commercial operating system based on ChromiumOS that only runs on Chromebooks, Chromeboxes and tablet computers. Like Android, it has the Google Play Store and other Google apps. Support for applications that require GNU compatibility is available through a virtual machine called Crostini and referred to by Google as Linux support, see Chromebook § Compatibility with Linux applications (GNU compatibility).</p>

      <p><b>Whether the above operating systems count as a "Linux distribution" is a controversial topic.</b> They use the Linux kernel, so the Linux Foundation and Chris DiBona, Google's open-source chief, agree that Android is a Linux distribution; others, such as Google engineer Patrick Brady, disagree by noting the lack of support for many GNU tools in Android, including glibc.</p>

    <h2>Lightweight distributions</h2>
      <b>Lightweight Linux distributions are those that have been designed with support for older hardware in mind</b>, allowing older hardware to still be used productively, or, for maximum possible speed in newer hardware by leaving more resources available for use by applications. Examples include Tiny Core Linux, Puppy Linux and Slitaz.
Niche distributions

    <h2>Other distributions target specific niches, such as</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Routers – for example, targeted by OpenWrt and pfSense</li>

      <li>Home theater PCs – for example, targeted by KnoppMyth, Kodi (former XBMC) and Mythbuntu</li>
      <li>Specific platforms – for example, Raspberry Pi OS targets the Raspberry Pi platform</li>
      <li>Education – examples are Edubuntu and Karoshi, server systems based on PCLinuxOS</li>
      <li>Scientific computer servers and workstations – for example, targeted by Scientific Linux</li>
      <li>Digital audio workstations for music production – for example, targeted by Ubuntu Studio</li>
      <li>Computer Security, digital forensics and penetration testing – examples are Kali Linux and Parrot Security OS</li>
